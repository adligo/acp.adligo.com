# Adligo Code Puzzles
This will be Adligo's website for code puzzles.

### IANA 
These puzzles will be uniquely identified by IANA numbers under;
1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7

## Categories
##### 1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.0
The puzzles will be broken down into a matrix of categories based on what they generally do (aka output).  They will appear under this IANA number.


##### [Creation#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.0.0](creation/AllCreationIds.md)
##### [Search#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.0.1](search/AllSearchIds.md)      
##### [Selection#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.0.2](selection/AllSelectionIds.md)  
##### [Identification#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.0.3](identification/AllIdentificationIds.md)
##### [Exploration#1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.0.4](exploration/AllExplorationIds.md)

## Cross Reference Categories
##### 1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.1
These categories provide a cross-reference to how the puzzles are solved.

## Difficulty Levels
##### 1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.2

The initial guess of how challenging the puzzle is ranked under the following IANA number (appending a .0-100)).
##### 1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.2.0

Once statistics can be gathered about attempts by humans to solve the problem, they will be tracked under the following number (appending a .0-100)).
##### 1.3.6.1.4.1.33097.7.2.1
